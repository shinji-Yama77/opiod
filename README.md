### Purpose
Understanding and addressing drug overdose death rates within different demographic groups is crucial due to its profound impact on public health and social well-being. We believe it is important because it sheds light on disparities in healthcare outcomes, highlights vulnerable populations, and informs targeted interventions. By examining overdose rates across demographics, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and community organizations can develop tailored strategies to prevent overdoses, improve access to treatment and support services, and ultimately save lives.
